TESTBbot

Background
The idea for this app came to me when I was trying to get an appointment for driving test after months of completing my driving lessons. I soon realised that to get any favourable dates, I had to spend my whole day monitoring and reloading the DVSA website to get a cancellation that opens up ones in a bluemoon.As someone who loves to design and create apps, I felt I could outsource this task to one of my creations hence the birth of TESTbot.

What Can The App Do
- It periodically scans the DVSA website and send an alert to the user with available dates
- Its able to filter new dates from previous dates in order not to send repeated dates to user
- It employs a simple but effective proprietary solution to evade bot detection algorithm on the DVSA webste


What Tech Stack was used
- Node Js was used for the backend 
- Libraries used include EJS and puppeteer.js


#this app has been shutdown after DVSA refused approval for it to be used on commercial basis. Athough you can have a look at the code behind it, the main algorithm to beat the bot detection software has been remove so using will most likely fail after a couple of day becuase their bot detection will eventually detect its.
